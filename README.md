- Seed is a number that determines how the maze would generate; different seeds would generate distinct mazes.
- Press 's' to finish entering the seed and start the game.

*An alternative: Press 'r' to skip manually entering the seed number and use a randomly generated seed.*



### The Start:
![start](https://github.com/alexxuyaowen/maze/blob/master/Maze/Demo/start.PNG)
- At the start of a game, the player has a health of 256, vision of 2, obscured vision of 1.
- The degree of obscured vision equals to half of the degree of normal vision.



### Collect Visions:

- Collecting a vision (the sun symbol) would increment the player's vision by 1, allowing the character to see more.



### Trigger a Lightning:

- A lightning would enable the player to temporarily view the entire maze.
- A lightning would appear on a random place in the maze after every 5 collections of the vision.
